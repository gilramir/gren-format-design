# The Design of "gren format"

This web app is the design document for the upcoming "gren format" tool,
the pretty-printer for [Gren](https://gren-lang.org/).

It is a discussion of rendering choices for different parts of the language,
and can be read
[here](https://hangil.app/gren-format-design/).

The formatting examples use the
[Pretty Expressive Printer](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gilramir/gren-pretty-expressive)
package to render Gren syntax, because the "gren format" will do so too.
